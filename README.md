Essentials 
==========

Motivation
----------

Every time I install new machine I need to setup few common essntial goodies to feel comfortable. I need
* rpmfusion repo
* mc, screen, git, subversion and sublime-text
* Google Chrome
* mp3/mp4 players
* ssh keys
* [launchers] for menu launcher shortcuts collection

I wanted to script those repeating tasks, so I created this bunch of scripts for me (and maybe for others too).


Usage
------

To get started you could clone the repository from github:

    git clone git://github.com/4ndrej/essentials.git

or you can download partial scripts directly from github

    wget https://raw.github.com/4ndrej/essentials/master/f17-core.sh

Then maybe edit the script to fit your needs or run it as is.


How can I help?
---------------

Once you have **forked the project**, send a **pull request** to improve this little script collection.
